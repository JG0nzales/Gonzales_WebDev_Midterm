  <h1>Is it Too Much</h1>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>A Man can handle only much
    <p>But can life be enough
    <p>A Man in sea sees only the sky and sea
    <p>But waves disrupt peace of the scene</p>
      
      <br>
      
     <p>Is life a Question
       <p>Why does Man seek answer
     <p>Is being too much enough
    <p>Why does Man only see the bluff</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>What can be enough for the Man
      <p>Is owning the world enough of too much
     <p>Who tells the Man what is too much
    <p>Why bother what Man does, Man himself is already too much</p>
